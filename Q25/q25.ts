//Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// Variable to store the alien's color
let aliencolor: string = 'green';

// If statement to test whether the alien's color is green
if (aliencolor === 'green') {
    // Print a message that the player just earned 5 points
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points for shooting down the green alien.");
}

// Variable to store the alien's color
let aliencolour: string = 'red';

    // Print a message that the player just earned 5 points
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points for shooting down the green alien.");
