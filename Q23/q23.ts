//23.Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
// Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let x: number = 5;
let y: number = 10;

// Test 1: Is x equal to 5?
console.log("Is x equal to 5? I predict True.");
console.log(x === 5);

// Test 2: Is y equal to 10?
console.log("Is y equal to 10? I predict True.");
console.log(y === 10);

// Test 3: Is x not equal to 10?
console.log("Is x not equal to 10? I predict True.");
console.log(x !== 10);

// Test 4: Is y not equal to 5?
console.log("Is y not equal to 5? I predict True.");
console.log(y !== 5);

// Test 5: Is x less than y?
console.log("Is x less than y? I predict True.");
console.log(x < y);

// Test 6: Is x greater than y?
console.log("Is x greater than y? I predict False.");
console.log(x > y);

// Test 7: Is x less than or equal to 0?
console.log("Is x less than or equal to 5? I predict False.");
console.log(x <= 0);

// Test 8: Is y greater than or equal to 15?
console.log("Is y greater than or equal to 10? I predict False.");
console.log(y >= 15);

// Test 9: Is x equal to 10?
console.log("Is x equal to 10? I predict False.");
console.log(x === 10);

// Test 10: Is y less than 5?
console.log("Is y less than 5? I predict False.");
console.log(y < 5);
