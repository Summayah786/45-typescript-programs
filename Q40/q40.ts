//40.Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of
//tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
